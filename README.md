# Travel App Project

## Overview
This application allows you to get information about the entered city (temperature, image) and the difference between the entered dates

## Description
Geonames API provides width and longitude. Depending on the entered city, its data will be determined and the user will receive the temperature. If the entered date is greater than the current one, then we get the maximum predicted temperature, if less then the current temperature. There are 2 date fields: end and start. After entering, the user will see the duration of the trip in days. Also, based on the entered city, an image will be displayed
